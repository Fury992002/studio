/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Prototyping.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes rapid prototyping by granting public read and write access to all documents.
 * It is intended for development and testing purposes ONLY and should NOT be used in a production environment.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles, accessible by anyone.
 * - /documents/{documentId}: Stores invoices and quotations, accessible by anyone.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - All data is publicly readable and writable.
 * - No user authentication or authorization is required.
 * - This configuration is highly insecure and should be replaced with a production-ready ruleset before deployment.
